# Fundamentals of Modeling & Fabrication

## Student Introduction
My name is MUGABIYIMANA ELYSE, and I am a Master of Science student specializing in IoT Embedded Computing Systems (ECS). This portfolio presents my learning progress and practical experiences in Modeling & Fabrication.

## Course Overview
This documentation examines the fundamental idea that design and fabrication are deeply interconnected.

Rather than focusing only on manufacturing, this module emphasizes that modern design is computationally driven, informed by material properties, and conscious of production processes.

### Core Principles
!!! quote "Design-to-Fabrication Continuum"
Design is not a linear sequence but a continuous and iterative process consisting of the following stages:

 1. **Design:** Defining goals and intentions.  
2. **Modeling:** Expressing geometry, logic, and functionality.  
3. **Prototyping:** Validating ideas through experimentation.  
4. **Fabrication:** Converting digital models into physical objects.  
5. **Evaluation:** Analyzing results and refining the design.


# Digital Modeling

## Modeling Process

Modeling goes beyond drawing shapes; it serves as a structured representation of form, logic, and behavior. My workflow integrates two main modeling approaches:

Geometric Modeling: Creating fixed shapes with precise physical dimensions.

Parametric and Rule-Based Modeling: Applying adjustable parameters to allow flexibility and variation without rebuilding the model.

## Design Rationale
Each design decision was made with the awareness that the chosen fabrication technique directly influences the design itself.

### Parametric Approach
Through parametric thinking, my models function as experimental tools, enabling me to:

Evaluate assumptions related to fit and performance.

Rapidly modify parameters in response to changing physical or fabrication constraints.

# Fabrication Strategy

## Fabrication Methods
To convert digital designs into tangible objects, I analyzed the four primary digital fabrication approaches [cite: 44]:

**Additive Manufacturing**: Building objects layer by layer, such as 3D printing.

**Subtractive Manufacturing**: Removing material, for example through CNC milling.

**Formative Processes**: Shaping materials using molds or applied forces.

**Hybrid Techniques**: Integrating multiple fabrication methods for improved outcomes.

## Material and Tolerance Awareness
Physical fabrication introduces real-world limitations that are often absent in digital environments.

<!-- !!! warning "Designing for Imperfection"
    As noted in our coursework, real-world fabrication inevitably introduces **error and deformation**. 
    
    **Tolerance:** I designed my parts with specific **tolerance limits** to ensure proper fit despite machine inaccuracy.
    **Material Behavior:** The choice of material actively influenced the design outcome, requiring adjustments for shrinkage and flexibility. -->

# Reflections and Results

## Iterative Design Thinking
A key takeaway from this module is that design development is cyclical rather than sequential. Continuous feedback at each stage enabled progressive improvement before final fabrication.

### Learning Through Failure
Each prototype failure was viewed not as an error, but as a valuable learning opportunity. This evidence-based design approach helped reveal the practical limitations of the machines and processes used.

## Ethics and Sustainability
In addition to technical learning, I considered the broader implications of my design work:

Sustainability: Minimizing material waste and energy consumption.

Responsibility: Promoting designs that support reuse, repair, and longevity instead of disposability.

## Achieved Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I developed the ability to
1.  **Design with fabrication constraints** in mind.
2.  **Analyze material properties** and their influence on final form.
3.  **Convert conceptual ideas** into practical, manufacturable systems.
